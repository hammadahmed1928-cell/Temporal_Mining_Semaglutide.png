# Temporal Knowledge Mining in Pharmacovigilance

### 🏥 Project Overview
Traditional clinical trials (Phase III) are static and limited in sample size. This project implements a **computational pipeline** to mine post-market surveillance data (FAERS) via the **OpenFDA API**. The goal is to detect "temporal signals"—sudden spikes in adverse event reporting that indicate emerging safety risks.

### 🧪 Case Study: Semaglutide (Ozempic)
* **Target Drug:** Semaglutide (GLP-1 Agonist)
* **Data Source:** FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)
* **Methodology:** Time-series extraction of reporting velocity.

### 📊 Results (Visualized)

### 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.9
* **Libraries:** `Pandas` (Data Structuring), `Matplotlib` (Visualization), `Requests` (API Handling)
* **Technique:** Automated JSON Parsing & Temporal Aggregation.
